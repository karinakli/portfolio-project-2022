    description: 'This project was my final project for my CS107: Computer Organizations & Systems class. Our assignment was to recreate a working implicit and explicit heap allocator which aligned with the current C documentation. I had to design my program for requests such as malloc, realloc, and free while ensuring correctness, tight utilization, and speed. \n My heap allocator allowed me to master my pointer and debugging skills. It was important to have solid deconstruction, especially due to the scope of the project. When designing my allocators, I first prioritized accuracy: making sure that the allocated memory could be found again and that there were no overlaps or leaks in memory. Although this assignment was incredibly difficult, I was very proud to see the final finished product!',

We used The Movie API database to access the up-to-date movie information. This was a cumulative project from the Stanford Women in Computer Science Fellows program. As a Fellow, I worked with a partner to learn the basics of React Native and create a functioning mobile app. I really enjoyed working with other people on this project, which made debugging a lot more pleasant.'

    description: 'This portfolio website was built to showcase my work experiences and projects. I wanted to create a simple, minimalist UI that had small animations embedded within the CSS. To carry out these expectations, I learned to utilize the ReactJS library along with CSS through styled-components. I followed the necessary steps needed to design this website, including mood boarding, wireframing, and prototyping. It was my first time using both Figma and ReactJS, and I really enjoyed combining design and coding together in a project. I am excited to continue exploring Product Design and Computer Science more in future classes and projects.',

    description: 'This project was the final project for my CS106B: Programming Abstractions class. In this assignment, I was asked to implement the Huffman coding algorithm, which pulls concepts from the entire quarter. I utilized trees, queues, linked structures, recursive exploration, and streaming algorithms. Writing this Huffman Coding algorithm was very fulfilling, especially when watching all the different parts come together in the end to create a working program. I was very excited to see the progress I had made since the beginning of the class!'
