                Hello! I am Karina Li from Orange County, California. I am a sophomore at Stanford University majoring
                in Computer Science with a focus on Human-Computer Interaction. I am passionate about 
                exploring new ideas and bringing them to life through the intersection of 
                technology and art. 
                <br /> <br />
                This past summer I worked as an App Development Intern at {' '}
                <AboutAccentP href="https://rooster-app.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Rooster</AboutAccentP>
                , a location-based mobile app startup for searching and booking a broad range of childrenâ€™s 
                extracurricular activities. 
                <br /> <br />
                Besides coding, you can find me performing with my dance teams, crocheting room decor, and playing 
                solitaire!
